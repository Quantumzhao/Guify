# Guify

This is a tool to generate a simple GUI for a CLI command. The user would only need to supply a simple XML file defining the expected representation of various flags and verbs in such a CLI command. 

## Installation



## What it is

By using Guify, users donâ€™t need to always refer to the `--help` page or `man` when they only want to use the mere basics of a complex tool. In such way, users who have a hard time memorizing things (just like me), can always rely on the GUI until they get familiarized. 

## What it is not

The ultimate replacement for CLI tools. 

## XML file

The extension for such files are `.gui`. They can be placed anywhere, as long as it is configured. 

This tool also comes with a set of XSD schemas to help users create valid XML documents. They are located in `./UI/Schemas`
